## Professional Experience

### Senior SDET @ Kforce Inc. (Client: HP & Paramount+), Austin, TX

**Nov 2022 ‚Äì May 2025**

* Developed and maintained automated UI test suites with XCUI and Appium, ensuring consistent pass rates in CI/CD pipelines
* Extended framework capabilities using Appium and Swift to integrate platform-specific test hooks and performance optimizations
* CI/CD Configuration: Integrate tests into GitLab CI, Jenkins, Travis (Docker/Kubernetes) to enable fast, 
* Metrics & Visualization: Publish pass/fail trends and performance dashboards via Grafana, Allure Reports¬∑, ExtentReports, and chatbot alerts.
* Mentorship: Pair program with and coach Junior SDETs on test design, framework patterns, and best practices.

**Key Achievements:**

* Elevated UI-test stability from 85% to 97% by designing and implementing end-to-end scenarios in XCUITest and Espresso that simulate video play, pause, seek, and background-foreground transitions under varying network conditions; integrated with GitLab CI in Docker to catch regressions within 15 minutes.
* Reduced flaky tests by 70% through Appium-based platform hooks that dynamically adjust timeouts and retry on known render-delay issues; slashed average pipeline runtime by 25% and improved overall pass rate to 99% in our Kubernetes-powered Jenkins environment.
*  8 Improved user-perceived performance by 40% by embedding Swift-based performance probes around video-startup and buffer-fill routines, capturing metrics in Allure Reports and Grafana dashboards; surfaced critical regressions pre-release, preventing a 2√ó increase in customer-reported buffering incidents.

### SDET @ Apple, Sunnyvale, CA

**Nov 2021 ‚Äì Nov 2022**

* Built ETL API tests using TestNG, Postman, and Rest-Assured for the Apple Store Catalog.
* Implemented UI automation for iOS with XCUITest and web with Playwright and Cypress using BDD methodologies.

**Key Achievements:**

* Automated tests for 10+ microservices and migrated mocks to WireMock.
* Reduced false positives by 50% through optimized page objects, parallel execution, and refined timeouts.
* Introduced AI-driven bug triage and Gherkin test generation to streamline test creation.

### SW Test Engineer II @ Dexcom, San Diego, CA

**Jul 2020 ‚Äì Jun 2021**

* Led API, web, Android, and iOS testing programs across 60+ countries, ensuring FDA compliance.
* Managed high-compliance documentation and audit readiness for clinical applications.
* Executed manual firmware testing with CGM simulators and hardware interfaces.

**Key Achievements:**

* Increased automated coverage to 80%, enhancing regression reliability.
* Delivered validated clinical apps within a two-month development cycle.

### Sr. SDET @ Bukalapak.com, Jakarta, Indonesia

**Nov 2016 ‚Äì Sep 2019**

* Developed end-to-end test suites for Android, iOS, web, and APIs using BDD with Selenium and Appium.
* Integrated automation into GitLab CI, Jenkins, and Travis CI within Docker/Kubernetes environments.

**Key Achievements:**

* Fast-tracked to Senior SDET as the youngest team member.
* Presented test automation best practices at the Selenium Conference in Tokyo.
