## Professional Experience

### Senior SDET @ Deloitte India., Hyderabad, TG

**Feb 2022 ‚Äì Till Date**

* Developed and maintained automated UI test suites with Serenity 4 and Java using Selenium, ensuring consistent pass rates in CI/CD pipelines
* Extended framework capabilities using Jenkins and JMeter to integrate platform-specific test hooks and performance optimizations
* CI/CD Configuration: Integrate tests into GitHub CI, Jenkins, Travis (Docker/Kubernetes) to enable fast, 
* Metrics & Visualization: Publish pass/fail trends and performance dashboards via Serenity Reports, Allure Reports¬∑, ExtentReports.
* Mentorship: Pair program with and coach Junior SDETs on test design, framework patterns, and best practices.

**Key Achievements:**

* Elevated UI-test stability from 85% to 97% by designing and implementing end-to-end scenarios in Serenity BDD and Selenium that simulate video play, pause, seek, and background-foreground transitions under varying network conditions; integrated with GitLab CI in Docker to catch regressions within 15 minutes.
* Reduced flaky tests by 70% through Selenium-based platform hooks that dynamically adjust timeouts and retry on known render-delay issues; slashed average pipeline runtime by 25% and improved overall pass rate to 99% in our Kubernetes-powered Jenkins environment.
*  8 Improved user-perceived performance by 40% by embedding Swift-based performance probes around video-startup and buffer-fill routines, capturing metrics in Allure Reports and Grafana dashboards; surfaced critical regressions pre-release, preventing a 2√ó increase in customer-reported buffering incidents.

### SDET @ Vertafore, Hyderabad, TG

**Sep 2017 ‚Äì Jan 2022**

* Built Restful APIs tests using TestNG, Postman, and Rest-Assured for the Legacy to Modernization Catalog.
* Implemented UI automation for Serenity BDD and web with Playwright and Cypress using BDD methodologies.

**Key Achievements:**

* Automated tests for 10+ microservices and migrated mocks to WireMock.
* Reduced false positives by 50% through optimized page objects, parallel execution, and refined timeouts.
* Introduced AI-driven bug triage and Gherkin test generation to streamline test creation.

### Test Engineer @ Possibleworks, Hyderabad, TG

**Mar 2016 ‚Äì May 2017**

* Executed and Automated basic Web and Mobile E2E test cases and Migration of Files using Integration Manager.
* Managed high-compliance documentation and audit readiness for clinical applications.
* Executed manual firmware testing with CGM simulators and hardware interfaces.

**Key Achievements:**

* Increased automated coverage to 80%, enhancing regression reliability.
* Delivered validated Social Engagement app 1RWRDS within a two-month development cycle.
